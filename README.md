# Ocean Thermodynamics Analysis: Predicting Water Temperature from Salinity

Explored a potential linear relationship between ocean water salinity and temperature, developing predictive models using statistical regression techniques. Leveraged data from the CalCOFI dataset and examined the influence of salinity and depth on water temperature.

Utilized hypothesis testing and ANOVA to assess the significance of regression coefficients, ensuring reliable predictions. Employed diagnostic checks and outlier removal to enhance model accuracy, leading to a final multiple linear regression model with an adjusted R2 value of 0.9172.

Contributed to discussions on climate change prediction by establishing a connection between salinity, depth, and water temperature. Identified potential overfitting and unaccounted variables, suggesting future strategies like bootstrapping and additional variable consideration for model enhancement.
